Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-with-LeNet5-Model-in-PyTorch

Load Data:
Action: Load the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits.
Purpose: This dataset is used for training and testing the LeNet model to recognize handwritten digits.
Data Preprocessing:
One-hot Encoding:
Action: Convert class labels into one-hot encoded vectors.
Purpose: This is necessary for the neural network to understand the class labels.
Data Reshaping:
Action: Reshape the input data to match the input dimensions the LeNet model expects.
Purpose: Ensure that the data is in the correct format for the model to process.
Data Augmentation:
Action: Apply transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to the training data.
Purpose: Increase the diversity of the training dataset to improve the model's generalization.
Data Sampling:
Action: Sample the data to create training and testing subsets.
Purpose: Ensure that the model is trained on one subset and tested on another to evaluate its performance.
Initialize LeNet Model:

Action: Load and initialize the architecture of the LeNet model.
Purpose: Set up the structure of the neural network that will be trained to recognize digits.
Define Model Components:

Define Loss Function:
Action: Choose a loss function such as Cross-Entropy Loss.
Purpose: Measure the error between the model's predictions and the actual labels.
Define Optimizer and Dense Layers:
Action: Choose an optimizer (e.g., Adam or SGD) and define any additional dense layers if needed.
Purpose: The optimizer adjusts the weights of the model to minimize the loss function.
Train Model:

Action: Train the model on the training data using the defined loss function and optimizer.
Purpose: Adjust the model's weights to minimize the loss function, effectively teaching the model to recognize digits.
Test Model:

Action: Evaluate the trained model on the testing data.
Purpose: Assess the model's performance and its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
Evaluate and Improve Accuracy:

Action: Analyze the model's performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
Purpose: Identify areas of improvement and apply techniques like hyperparameter tuning, further data augmentation, or architecture modifications to enhance the model's accuracy
